DCU Final Year Project - MyTrip

MyTrip is a web application that uses machine learning algorithms to recommend users with points of interest, attractions and restaurants in a city they are interested in travelling to. The goal of the project is to improve the experience of travelling in a city you know nothing about. The app displays recommendations to the user in their desired location based off of their interests.

Accurate recommendations are calculated using the following methods:
Collaborative Filtering
  -Matrix factorisation
Sentiment Analysis
  -Natural language processing
 
Collaborative Filtering:
In order to get recommendations for our users, collaborative filtering proved to produce the most accurate results. To implement collaborative filtering, we used matrix factorisation. This makes recommendations based on other users that the web application believes you are most similar to.

Sentiment Analysis:
If an event/attraction/restaurant or point of interest has reviews, our system will perform sentiment analysis using a machine learning algorithm
Through natural language processing and using recurrent neural networks, we will try and accurately predict a percentage rating indicating if the event/attraction was liked or disliked by the community
